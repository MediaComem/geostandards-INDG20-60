=== Interoperability in the field of geoinformation, from eCH to OGC

Recently, in 2022, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) have renewed their Memorandum of Understanding. While the initial agree- ment dates from 2008, this renewal is especially motivated by the current focus on the OGC APIs and the will to empower developers (even non-geospatial) to leverage location in their development. Indeed, the OGC has initiated the creation of a new generation of standards based on the OpenAPI specifications to facilitate the integration of geospatial data in modern web applications and systems.

Underpinning the OGC Standards Roadmap cite:[ogc-roadmap] <<ogc-roadmap>>, the development of all these standards represents a significant number of activities carried out by various OGC working groups, Testbeds and pilots from the OGC Innovation Program <<ogc-ip>>. Some standards have been approved, many are still under development and it is therefore not always easy to follow their progress. Indeed, while some geodata infrastructures involving national entities as the(e.g. Meteorological Service of Canada <<eccc-msc>> in Canada) are already deploying this new generation of standards, some initiatives run a phase of experimentation such as for instance the Geonovum OGC API Testbed Platform <<apitestbed>>.

From a practical perspective we can ask the question how organizations and institutions anticipate to leverage this new generation of standards in order to deploy a geospatial data infrastructure. This issue is at the core of this article and at the center of a project that seeks to address the issue by running an OGC API Testbed platform with a special focus to the Swiss context. This project is embedded in the NGDI Resources program related to the Swiss Geoinformation Strategy <<indg>> with the purpose to contribute to the upcoming revision of Swiss e-government standards regarding geoinformation such as the eCH-0056 <<eCH-0056>> standard. This project is about a research carried out by academic partners (HEIG-VD, SUPSI, UNIGE) as well as the Swiss Office for Topography Swisstopo.

=== Swiss National Context

In Switzerland the exchange and publication of geographic in- formation is governed by the Federal Act on Geoinformation (GeoIA) <<geoia>>. The GeoIA is accompanied by two regulations:

* GeoIV / OGeo (Federal Council Ordinance) <<ogeo>>
* GeoIV / OGeo-swisstopo (Ordinance specific for the Federal Office of Topography swisstopo) <<ogeo-swisstopo>>

The GeoIV / OGeo contains the fundamental provisions, while the GeoIV / OGeo-swisstopo regulates the technical details, which can be modified by the competent federal office (swisstopo), with the participation of the cantons and after consulta- tion with different partner organisations:

* http://www.ech.ch[eCH], a national association for the estab- lishment of e-government standards
* https://www.sogi.ch[SOGI/OSIG], a national association for geoinformation
* https://www.kgk-cgc.ch[KGK-CGC], an organization of the Swiss Cantons in the field of geoinformation management

The GeoIV/OGeo-swisstopo specifies criteria such as the geo- detic reference system, the description language for modeling geospatial data, metadata standards for geoinformation and minimal requirements for geodata.

In its 7th article: ”Minimal requirements for geoservices”, the GeoIV / OGeo-swisstopo refers to the e-Government standard eCH-0056 entitle Application Profile for Geoservices <<eCH-0056>>, which defines the implementation of basic geoservices by means of a set of additional guidelines and recommendations which make the services suitable for practical use. In addition, there are other regulations, such as metadata models <<gm03>> and protocols for the exchange of base geodata under federal law.

As the eCH-0056 document currently refers to the WxS family of OGC specifications (WMS, WMTS, WFS, WCS, CSW, SE, SLD, SOS), our research aims to assess the maturity and the benefits of the new OGC APIs in the perspective of a revision of its legal framework.

=== Methodology

Given the above general purpose, the intent is to develop knowledge and practice of these OGC API standards so as, for instance, to update guidelines of the instructions stated by eCH- 0056. More generally, how can the advances coming out from the OGC standardization process be integrated into the Swiss standardization process and even vice versa. The idea in this project is to setup a Testbed Platform to connect these two processes as illustrated by figure 1 by considering issues related to how requirements defined by stakeholders are handled by standardization works both sides. By running at each iteration a showcase on specific use cases with a set of standards to challenge, the Testbed Platform brings results as update guidelines (e.g. for eCH working groups in the field of geoinformation) and feedbacks (e.g. OGC Change Requests). In addition, such a vision can provide an opportunity for dissemination and training material creation (e.g. tutorials, workshops).

Several activities are to be carried out to feed and run such a platform, among them: requirements analysis with stakeholders, identification of underlying standards to challenge, subscription/following in the relevant standards working groups, definition of experimental cases and evaluation criteria, deployment and maintenance of software to run showcases, documentation and dissemination.

For this project, to be seen as a first iteration, the expected outcomes include both quantitative and qualitative results that will be compiled into practical e-government guidelines for the implementation of standards from the OGC API family. The selected mainstream topic for the showcase and the underlying experimental cases is about climate change. While not yet connected in a complex pilot study, each case represents some of the required components from sensors to portrayal. The study is organized in three parts to challenge standards with software related to: (1) sensors data (2) data discovery, access and portrayal (3) earth observation data.

In term of software, the idea is to offer a unique project entry point for the discovery, experimentation and analysis of the new OGC APIs. To develop the knowledge and practice required, openness is not only related to the standards evaluated, but also required for the software aspects of the Testbed platform. That’s why we identified the Geonovum OGC API Testbed tooling stack <<apitestbed>> as a good base. It includes already open sourceopen-source packages and provides a detailed documentation available on GitHub. We deployed a project instance at https://ogc.heig-vd.ch/[https://ogc.heig-vd.ch/] (figure 2) which still needs to get populated with the underlying data and configured to serve everything required to run the experimental cases, from server to client sides. This solution will also be used to create tutorials in the style of the documentation proposed by Meteo Canada <<eccc-msc>>.

This solution is expected to bring good visibility toward all actors concerned by the Swiss standardization process. It is to raise interest from government stakeholders, companies and universities, technical people or not, as a community in synergy when considering the advances at the OGC.

To test the experimental cases, FOSS4G implementations are deployed, especially server-side software with:

//FROST
* https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/en/projects-and-products/frost-server.html[FROST] : focusing on sensor observation standards
//Geoserver
* https://geoserver.org[Geoserver] : quite active in the implementation of a wide set of OGC API standards
* https://github.com/interactive-instruments/ldproxy[ldproxy] : focusing on OGC API Features as an adapter sitting in front of existing WFS services
* https://pygeoapi.io[pygeoapi] : active in the implementation with the largest set of OGC API standards of the panel
* https://qgis.org[QGIS Server] : quite active community in Switzerland, implementing also an OGC API Features client

The choice of these solutions was made to cover all the standards to be challenged in this project as well as with the variety of programming languages of the most common OSGeo software, the ease of deployment and the quality of their documentation. Table 1 has been built by going over the OGC API landing page of each, in conformance with the Landing Page Requirements Class of the specification OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core (OGC, 2021a).
