== From OWS to web architecture

=== OWS Common

The OGC Web Services Common (https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=38867[OWS Common]) provides guidance to OGC members who are developing OGC interface implementation standards. The purpose of OWS Common is to maintain consistency among OGC standards. OWS Common provides rules for specifying some of the parameters and data structures used in operation requests and responses. Each interface standard details additional aspects, including specifying all additional parameters and data structures needed in all operation requests and responses. The following is a list of some common aspects covered by OWS Common document:

* GetCapabilities operation (request, parameters, response)
* Exception reports
* Operations parameters:
    ** Bounding box
    ** Coordinate reference systems
    ** Format
    ** Data descriptions
    ** Mulitlingual text encodings
* Operation request and response encoding (HTTP GET and HTTP POST)
* Guidance for OWS Implementation Specifications

=== OGC API Common

https://ogcapi.ogc.org/common[OGC API - Common] is a common framework used in all OGC API's. 
OGC API - Common is build on the legacy of OWS Common and provides a common framework for all OGC APIs with the following code functionalities:

* based on https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html[OpenAPI 3.0]
* HTML and JSON as the dominant encodings, alternative encodings are possible
* common and shared endpoints such as:
    ** `/` (landing page)
    ** `/conformance`
    ** `/openapi`
    ** `/collections`
    ** `/collections/foo`
* common aspects such as pagination, links between resources, basic filtering, query parameters (`bbox`, `datetime`, etc.)

OGC API - Common allows for specification developers to focus on the key functionality of a given API (i.e. data access, etc.) while using common constructs. This harmonizes OGC API standards and enables deeper integration with less code. This also allows for OGC API client software to be more streamlined.

The `/conformance` endpoint indicates which standards and extensions are supported by a deployment of OGC API.

#### OGC API building blocks

The OGC API approach allows for modularity and "profiling" of APIs depending on your requirements.  This means you
can mix and match OGC APIs together.
