== Work Package 3 (WP3)
The Work Package 3 (named hereafter WP3) has the intent to evaluate the current OGC standards related to vector data.

Namely, we'll investigate the:

* https://www.ogc.org/standards/ogcapi-features[OGC-API Features]
* https://ogcapi.ogc.org/styles/[OGC-API Styles]
* https://ogcapi.ogc.org/maps/[OGC-API Maps]
* https://ogcapi.ogc.org/tiles/[OGC-API Tiles]
* https://ogcapi.ogc.org/records/[OGC-API Records]

=== Motivations

=== Approach

The idea is to set-up, experiment and compare the different standards trough different implementations to extrapolate practical considerations and advantages and disadvantages of the different OGC specifications.

As part of WP3, the following solutions have been investigated:
 
* https://carto.com/[Carto] (JavaScript based implementation)
* http://geoserver.org/[Geoserver] (Java based implementation)
* https://pygeoapi.io/[pygeoapi] (python based implementation)
* https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/fr/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/server/index.html[QGIS Server] (C++ based implementation)
